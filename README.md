Here you can see your vue project already built and injected using vscode webview API. you can utilize the full functionality of vue such as its amazing reactivity and its available plugins out of the box!

when you start developing on the `/packages/client/` vue application directory, your changes will be watched using nodemon, then rebuilt and be opened inside vscode extension host ready to be used with vscode command pallate!

Inside the vue application code, the `vscode` object is globally injected and can be used to send messages to the vscode runtime and perform tasks such as read/writing files, etc.
